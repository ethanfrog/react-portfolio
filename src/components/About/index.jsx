        Hi there! I'm a computer science graduate that's seeking an entry-level position in the field of software development.
        I recently completed a web design boot camp at MSU to bolster my skill set, and this portfolio serves as a demonstration of what I learned there.
        </p>

        Aside from programming, my other interests include UI/UX design, graphic design and creative writing.
