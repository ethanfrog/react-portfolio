        Hi there! I'm a computer science graduate that's seeking an entry-level position in the field of web design.
        I recently completed a web design boot camp at MSU to bolster my skill set in this area, and this portfolio serves as a demonstration of what I learned there.

        Aside from programming, my other interests include typography, creative writing and graphic design.
